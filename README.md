## MVP

### Project-build Aspects:

The following components are used to build the code for this project:

BACKEND: 
1. Handlebar.js: to handle templating language
2. Sequelize: to handle Object-relational Mapping
3. NPM packages:
    - bcrypt
    - connet-session-sequelize
    - dotenv
    - express
    - express-handlebars
    - express-session
    - mysql2
    - sequelize

FRONTEND:
1. CSS
2. JavaScript
3. Materialize

### Functionality:

The following lists all functions within this project:

* user can see homepage with nav bar and user posts
    - user can sign up or log in
    - user can see individual posts and comments
* user can sign up for an account or log in to see a dashboard
    - dashboard displays option to create a new post
    - dashboard displays any posts already created with options to edit or delete
* user can edit or delete post then be redirected to dashboard
* user can, once logged in, make comments on posts
* user can log out and then be redirected to dashboard
* user will be logged out after 5 min of inactivity

### Process:
#### Tasks

* sequelize is used to seed a database using models
* brcrypt is used to hash user passwords to maintain security
* MySQL Workbench is used to check seeded database tables
* express.js is used to create perform RESTful CRUD operations
* Insomnia CORE is used to test express.js controller routes
* session was used to indicate status of a user-log-in state
* handlebars.js is used to render data from CRUD operations onto front-end application
* materialize is used to create an easy to navigate UI/UX
* Heroku is used to deploy the application

### Beyond the MVP

A few useful items to make the application more approachable and user-friendly:
* notifications rather than alerts for 400/404 errors
* notifications for logging users out after 5 min of inactivity
* adding status if posts have been edited onto handlebars views
